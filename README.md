# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Model Comparison and Hyperparameter Tuning

This project trains, evaluates, and optimizes multiple machine learning classification models using the Breast Cancer dataset. It compares models using key metrics like **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**, and tunes their hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV** and **RandomizedSearchCV** to select the best performer.
